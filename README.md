# WarmBooks: Book Search and Management App

This project is a React-based web application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API, display a list of selected books, and manage the list with features such as pagination, book removal, and animations using Framer Motion. Book details, including the cover, title, author, and description, are fetched and stored locally in the browser.
